 XSTR("$BThe $BBehemoth


All hands, this is Captain Moran.

We have received a full report from Torgo HQ. Aside from the loss of the Kinney, Operation Prowl growl was a full success and I have now been authorized to tell you what it was about. The recent bioweapons attack on Locanda and other systems was a real wakeup call. The kilrathi are playing for keeps, and they have abandoned any sense of restraint. HQ is going to hit back, and we have no other option than to match, exceed, and overwhelm the Kilrathi's escalation. The key to that is the Behemoth.

The Behemoth is a series of linked, superconducting energy amplification conduits, focusing an output of five hundred million gigawatts into one lancing point. Any target at the end of that point is destroyed - even a planet. We are going to use it. The details of its deployment are classified, but High Command is confident that deploying it as planned will bring Confed a final and decisive victory to this war.", -1)

$Stage Text:
 XSTR("Prowl growl was about finding a suitable target for a demonstration of the weapon's power, both as an operational field test for our benefit and as a warning to the Kilrathi. If the demonstration is successful and the Emperor decides to continue the war, it is possible that several of the Kilrathi clans may rise up in rebellion against the Emperor and the royal family, who are already in an unstable position after the failure to take Earth during the Battle of Earth.

If they will not be deterred by this show of force, we are prepared to deploy the Behemoth in ways that will either force the enemy to their knees or, if necessary, wipe them out. Either way, Behemoth is expected and required to end this war before the Kilrathi have the time to build up for another strike that might finish us for good.", -1)

 XSTR("$BBluepoint $BStation


We have just finished a high-speed run through several friendly systems to reach our present position in Nephele. As I said last night, we are to play the bait in this operation and I know no better way to get the Cats attention than to walk right up to them and punch them in the nose.

The main Kilrathi presence in this system is a captured Confederation forward base, Bluepoint Station. Adding insult to their already wounding occupation, Intelligence believes this is another major raiding party hub for the Cats. We've tolerated their filth on Bluepoint's decks for long enough. Taking back the base intact and gaining a foothold in this system will enrage the Kilrathi far more than a simple raid on one of their battle groups, allowing the Behemoth to conduct its affairs free of intrusion from this flank.

Stay sharp. The Behemoth may be the final play in this conflict, but focusing too much on the prize and not on the tasks at hand had felled many quests throughout human history. We have to make sure this doesn't go down as one of those missed opportunities.

Moran out.", -1)
