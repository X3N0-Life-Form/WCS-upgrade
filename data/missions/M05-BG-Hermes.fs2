We have received some disturbing news. Science crew aboard the La Belle Dame Sans Merci station was in the middle of observing what appeared to be the formation of a new jump point. The information they were gathering could have lead to numerous scientific and technological breakthroughs.

Their observations were cut short when they were attacked by the Kilrathi, who had apparently been using a nearby nebula to hide their presence. The Kilrathi captured the station, killing much of the crew in the process and then torturing the rest to death. The Kilrathi then abandoned the station and destroyed it.

This was a senseless act of violence against a civilian target with no military value whatsoever. This is the eighteenth such occurrence in the last two years. Remember that this is the enemy we face, pilots.", -1)

We have successfully jumped into the Vega System, which holds particular importance to the war effort. Seventh Fleet Command has ordered us to defend the system, which has come under several attacks by small Kilrathi forces in the past few weeks.

As you all know, the Vega System is the capital of the Vega Sector and is the biggest industrial, business, and trading hub we have in the sector. Its loss or disruption would deliver a crippling blow to the economy of the whole sector. We must do all that we can to prevent it from being overrun.", -1)

It seems likely from the Kilrathi's recent maneuvers in Brimstone, reports of suspected Kilrathi jump activity in Trimble and the probing attacks into Vega, that the Cats are on the move and may be planning some major operations in the near future. While each of these could represent separate Kilrathi initiatives, we have to consider the possibility that this build up might mean something bigger will happen in one of these systems soon.

However, we have very limited intel about current Kilrathi operations in this sector. One thing is clear$semicolon Confed is in a vulnerable position here in Vega since we have evidence of Kilrathi presence in three adjacent systems: Brimstone, Alcor, and Trimble.

    XSTR("Lieutenants, excellent job on your patrol. You tangled with that Ace Fireclaw and both of you survived. That's not something many pilots can brag about... the ISS boys flying the Super Ferrets in Hotel flight learned that the hard way. Don't be too discouraged about Fireclaw escaping your grasp. His psych profile indicates that he's nothing more than a coward, running when the fight doesn't become fun for him anymore. A flight of Arrows were dispatched along his last vector. The only thing they picked up were jump traces consistent with a light carrier or heavy cruiser at the Trimble jump point. Rest assured, one day, Fireclaw's time will come. It's just a question of when.

Even though we believe this constituted the largest portion of the raiders, we're staying in system to assist cleaning up any stragglers. Again, good work today, gentlemen.", -1)
