Officers and crew of the Confederation Navy, this is Admiral Rumley. It is official. After the successful detonation of the prototype model on a seismographic fault in the Hyperion System today, President Quinson and the Scientific Warfare panel are debating the use of the Temblor bomb in six instances, including that of attacking the Kilrathi homeworld.

Expecting a positive decision within a few days, Confed HQ has decided to go ahead and commence operations to prepare the deployment of the Temblor Bomb against the Kilrah System.", -1)

 XSTR("$BKilrathi $BHome $BDefenses


As you may know, the Kilrathi have been gathering a sizable fleet in the H'rissth System in opposition to our own here in Freya. This in part explains the ending of the attacks on our territories. They are pooling their front line resources to stop any move we make toward their home system.

What you may not know is that over the past weeks, the Kilrathi have been assembling a massive armada, even larger than the one that lies between us and Kilrah, for what we assume is another full scale invasion against Earth.

Right now, the majority of that armada is still being refitted in their orbital shipyards. If they succeed in sortieing this fleet, we will not have any hope of stopping them. This is why we have to attack, and to attack now.", -1)

Thanks to the efforts of the Victory, we have secured the Freya System. We also have control of a backdoor jump point that leads straight to the Kilrah System. It is through this jump point that we will launch the Temblor Strike.

Here in Freya, we have built a command base and have rallied the entire Confederation Navy. We have assembled the largest battle fleet ever in the history of this War, numbering hundreds of capital ships.", -1)

$Stage Text:
 XSTR("$BBattle $BPlans


Jumping the entire fleet to Kilrah is not an option. Their assembling armada would be on top of us before we could get within strike range and with their H'rissth fleet as a reserve, it is guaranteed that they will decimate us within hours.

Jumping into H'rissth is also not an option. If we take the fight to the Cats in H'rissth, a portion of their armada could flank us by using the jump point to Freya and box us in, blocking our escape and ensuring our defeat. No ladies and gentlemen, the final stand will be right here, in Freya.

Our plan is to provoke the Kilrathi into committing their H'rissth forces to Freya. Here our fleet will engage the Kilrathi in a prolonged battle to thin out their numbers and diminish their strength. We will incite them to commit as many reinforcements as we can, hopefully even drawing the attention of the operational ships in Kilrah orbit.", -1)

 XSTR("$BHopeful $BPlans


It is our hope that we will raise enough of a ruckus that it will be too enticing for the Kilrathi not to consign a large chunk of their invasion force here to Freya. If we can goad them into that, the forces defending Kilrah will be diminished, leaving them more vulnerable to a T-Bomb attack.

Once the Kilrathi have their forces spread sufficiently thin, General Taggart will authorize the Victory to launch the Temblor Strike. Details of this action are strictly classified, but all units are expected to do whatever it takes to ensure the Victory's survival at all costs.", -1)

I am also issuing these contingency orders. If this operation fails and the chain of command is inaccessible, all remaining forces are to retreat back to Proxima. There we will stand our ground against the Kilrathi invasion.

That being said, I want to make something perfectly clear. Failure is not an option. If we fail here, then there is no future for humanity. When this campaign is over, the victor of this three decade conflict will be determined. Whether it will be humanity or the Kilrathi Empire will be decided by the events of this next week.

We will commence Phase One of the operation at 0600 hours tomorrow. Until then, make preparations for the battle and good luck. The survival of the human race is in our hands.", -1)

    XSTR("How good does it feel to kick the Cats out of their own system for the second time in a row, heh, Galahads? The only thing that would have made this more enjoyable would be to have finally put the Wratghar and that bastard Deathfang out of our misery, but I've got a feeling we'll get another crack at them in the coming days.

Speaking of which, we've received orders directly from Admiral Rumley that we are to take the next few rotations off. I argued with him against such an act, but a Lieutenant Colonel can't disagree with an Admiral for very long. He insists we've done more than our share and deserve a short break. We all did well, but most important of all, we all came back alive.

Get your rest while the remainder of the Confed fleet is assembled and moved into position. The hardest days the Confederation Navy and Space Forces have seen since the Battle of Earth are just ahead. Get your heads right and we all might live to tell the next generation of snot-nosed, hotshot rookies about it. Dismissed.", -1)
