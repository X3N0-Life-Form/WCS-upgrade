This is Captain Moran. May I remind those of you who are receiving this briefing that it is classified Top Secret. Any violation of the security restrictions of this information will be met with immediate capital punishment under the wartime codes of the Terran Confederation.

We have confirmation that a test of the Confederation's latest doomsday project has already been deemed successful. This project, the 'Temblor Bomb', is a special planet-killing warhead that takes advantage of the tectonic traits of a planet and literally shakes it apart.", -1)

 XSTR("$BFleet $BAction


With Freya coming under Confederation control and with the newly discovered jump point to the Kilrah system, HQ has deemed this a good staging area for a build-up to a fleet action. All carriers and warships from the Sol, Vega, Epsilon, and Enigma Sector Fleets are expected to rendezvous in Freya in preparation for the assault against the Kilrathi homeworld.

The Kilrathi forces in the Freya system have been emboldened by the arrival of the Wratghar into the fold after we drove it out of Hyperion. The Langley has continued her previous assignment, and has been joined by the Courageous. They are continually hounding the dreadnought and slowly dismantling the remaining cat forces.", -1)

We also just received word that the Kilrathi are working to mount another attempt to take back our foothold in their territory. They are not giving up without a 'tooth-and-nail' brawl. They have been assembling a fleet comparable to ours one system forward in H'rissth. No doubt this force is preparing to counter any action we might take.

Kilrathi forces have also returned to Kurasawa from Hellespont and are expanding into surrounding sectors in an attempt to cut us off from the rest of the Confederation. We can't let that happen. We must continue to build up our forces and we must keep our backs clear. We are in the Kilrathi's 'back yard' so to speak, but we must win the day. Succeed, and the road to Kilrah is open. Fail, and the war is over. I have every confidence in the men and women under this command. Failure, for us, is not an option.

Moran out.", -1)

    XSTR("We live to fight another day, boys. Excellent work in Kurasawa. That was a real sticky situation that could have tipped the scales of this operation either way. Invincible is well on its way to the Freya jump point. Bravo wing, those fighter transports you brought in were a welcome sight to every carrier captain in this fleet. We also just received word that, due largely to the Armageddon's assistance, the Philippine Sea battle group made it to Freya without a scratch and should join the fleet in a few hours.

I'm sure you saw the lessons the Kilrathi learned today. They were frustrated by a small but elite group of fighters, to the point where they decided to arrogantly commit their vessels to a blind sprint forward, all the while unaware that a Prowler scout had laid a nuclear minefield right in their path. Just another reason why you should never mess with the ONI Prowler corps.

We are preparing to jump to Freya to join the fleet. While we are there, we will help provide cover while more of our assets will arrive in system. Stay on your toes, though. Don't let your guard down because you think we may be safe. Complacency has no place on the front line. Dismissed.", -1)

While we've been spinning our wheels, the Kilrathi have built up another invasion fleet, this one much more powerful than the one that came within a gnat's ass of offing Earth last year.

We've been called back to Proxima to engage this new Kilrathi armada in a final stand, but I'm not going to blow sunshine up your ass, it doesn't look good. Even with the 3rd Fleet joining us, we've lost the Liberty and the Ticonderoga. Neither the Petrov or the Eagle are in any shape to fight, but will be there anyway. This is it, Galahads... desperation city. But I'll be damned if I'll go out without a fight.

I know I'm headed straight to Hell, but I'm going to make damn sure there's a lot more Cats down there to greet me when I arrive. We have a few days before we pull into Proxima. Time to get your shit together, people. Dismissed.", -1)
