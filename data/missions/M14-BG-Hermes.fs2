 XSTR("$BWhy $Bwe $Bfight


It appears that the rumor mill has been producing a rather bleak view of our current situation as of late. Especially after the latest news on the Kilrathi blitzkrieg attack against Bistango X.

You all know what I think of rumors and those who spread them. However, I do think it is my responsibility to help set the record straight on issues that may affect your morale.

I want you to keep something in mind: none of you know exactly how the war is going. In truth, things may be worse than you imagine, or they may be better. The only thing you have any certain knowledge of, and any control over, is the part of the war that is in front of you now, and the missions and objectives that are given to you.

If you cave to the rumors and approach the war as if it was already lost, then rest assured, you will lose and let down not only your fellow comrades here but also many good people back home who need us to turn things around.", -1)

As some of you might already know, we had a visit from a courier ship from Sector HQ today. Onboard was a special envoy carrying new orders. The Kilrathi's escalation to the use of bioweapons has been a wake-up call to all of us, and Confed is not turning a deaf ear to that call. Rest assured, we shall retaliate.

The specifics of our counterstrike are still classified. What I can tell you is that our orders are to survey the sector for a suitable target planet. This means extensive recon work, checking defenses, and surveying planets. This must all be done discretely, in order not to tip our hand to the Cats. Therefore, rather than utilizing a large strike force, five individual carriers will be sent to recon the prospective systems.

Our friends from the Bradshaw will go to the Hawkins system while the Kinney will deploy to Nifelheim. The Victory and Ticonderoga will do reconnaissance in Ariel and T'Rel Meh using the Caliban and Silenos nebulas for a covert approach, which the light carriers are well suited to carry out. The Hermes has been assigned to the Loki system. We are already under way.

Stay sharp, people, and keep your eyes open. We are operating behind enemy lines with minimal support on this one and every bit of intel we bring back has the potential to help us finally end this war.", -1)

One more thing. The scout ship Jim Bowie is joining us for this operation on loan from Fleet Intel. She has a Special Operations team onboard should the situation call for their assets. They have the highest security clearance and even I do not know their true names and military background. If they ask for your assistance, you need to drop whatever you're doing and comply.

Moran out.", -1)
