 XSTR("$BLocanda $BMassacre


We've received word from Vega Fleet Command that three days ago Prince Thrakhath's battle fleet launched a bioweapon attack on Locanda IV. Similar attacks have been reported in the Trafalgar and Delius systems.

These actions have stunned most of High Command. Not since the opening exchanges on Repleetah have biological weapons been used in this war. The regional death toll on Locanda IV has exceeded 10,000, with a virus-related mortality rate of 100%. To prevent the spread of the viral agent throughout the Confederation, the entire system has been placed under quarantine.

A new variable has been thrown into the mix of the War. Unless we act quickly, a decisive Kilrathi victory is imminent.", -1)

 XSTR("$BEvacuation $Bof $Bthe $BFront


As a result of the bioweapon attacks, TCN Headquarters is ordering the Fleet to evacuate all non-essential systems and regroup in systems of more strategic importance. As we speak, the TCS Victory is on her way to the Blackmane System to cover the evacuation of the naval base there.

We have also learned that Confed's plan for a diversionary strike on Alcor during our last action has failed. The Kilrathi anticipated this move and ambushed TCS Langley and TCS Cowpens during their approach through the Hellespont system, allowing the Kilrathi to strike at Vega in full force. TCS Cowpens has been destroyed and the Langley is in full retreat.

Make no mistake, we are between the proverbial 'rock and a hard place'. Unless we can devise a military solution for dealing with these new Kilrathi advances, Terran Confederation will be forced to recognize the Kilrathi's control of over half of the entire Vega Sector.", -1)

 XSTR("$BResupply


With the losses we have sustained recently, we are facing a significant shortage of fighters. We have spent the last eight days engaging in field repairs here at Proxima, and the cruiser Astoria has departed for Earth. She'll spend some time in dry dock before joining us again in about a week. As we wait for more supplies and new fighters to arrive, our battle group is now in a position to assume duties for perimeter patrol work and convoy escorts.", -1)
