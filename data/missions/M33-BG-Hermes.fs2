 XSTR("$BAssault $Bon $BCairo


Ladies and gentlemen, eight hours ago the Hermes and her battle group jumped into the Cairo system. As you may recall, the Cairo system has always held a significant strategic importance. It is rich in resources and was home to a major Confederation naval base before it fell to the Kilrathi five years ago.

It is situated in an ideal location along several important jump routes, allowing for rapid deployment of ships, equipment, and material from the naval base there. It was a heavy blow to us when we lost the system, and the Kilrathi have been taking advantage of its resources ever since. Confed has decided it is time to take the system back. We expect that the Kilrathi will put up a considerable fight, and we have every reason to believe that they have a strong military presence in the system, even with the withdrawal of the KIS Knathar back to Kilrah.", -1)

 XSTR("$BSuccessful $BRecon


While we may not know the full extent of Kilrathi forces in Cairo, the recon mission flown by Lieutenants Markham and Hasselbeck has provided us with clear and detailed information about the Cairo starbase and its defenses. As a result, we are now in the process of planning an assault designed to neutralize those defenses. We know it's going to be a tough fight, but we aren't going in blind and we can be prepared for what we will face. This is why we fly recon, and Lieutenants Markham and Hasselbeck are to be commended for their thorough work.", -1)

 XSTR("$BTactical $BParsimony


I have no doubt that some of you are wondering how our battlegroup will take the system. Indeed, a strike force consisting of one carrier and four warships seems like a rather minimal force for such an operation. We were scheduled to receive reinforcements for this operation, consisting of three Savannah class cruisers: the TCS Glasgow, the TCS Gloucester, and the TCS Liverpool. However, all three of these ships have been destroyed by Kilrathi assaults lead by the ace Bloodmist. Confed has decided that, rather than have us wait for more reinforcements to become available, we should proceed with what they termed a 'parsimonious strike'.

We are to use our limited forces to strike at key elements of the Kilrathi's forces in Cairo to disrupt their infrastructure and make their position in the system unsustainable, thus forcing them to abandon the system. In other words, we are required to do more with less. We will have to fight both harder and smarter and take some calculated risks. Therefore, discipline and adherence to orders is of the utmost importance in this operation, and I expect both from all of you.

Dismissed.", -1)
