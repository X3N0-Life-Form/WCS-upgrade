 XSTR("$B912th $B'Galahads'


This is Vice Admiral Rumley, commander of the Vega Sector Fleet. At ease.

We are now deploying the new F-103 Excalibur fighters to the front lines, of which several squadrons have recently entered service. The Hermes received a reinforced squadron of the Excaliburs, the new 912th Space Superiority Squadron... the Galahads.

General Taggart's operation just concluded in the Alcor System. Declassified details, sent to every carrier in the Fleet, indicate that the Victory just rescued a Dr. Severin, a demolitions expert whose knowledge is applicable to a second Confederation doomsday project. Our next plans are to lay the groundwork for the deployment of this weapon.", -1)

 XSTR("$BStrategic $Bsituation


The failure of the Behemoth has illustrated that we can't expect to employ a strategic weapon without first clearing the path of hostiles.

Therefore, before we deploy this new doomsday weapon, Command has ordered that several systems along the Front be securely in Confederation hands before operations proceed. That means the chances of successfully deploying this new weapon dramatically increase with each Kilrathi we eliminate.", -1)

For the time being, I have chosen the Hermes as my flagship for the upcoming campaign, and transferred additional personnel, fighter squadrons, and warships into this battle group.

We will immediately commence operations in the Hyperion System, a significant Kilrathi stronghold on the Terran-Kilrathi Border that is a major hub for their jump traffic. Meanwhile, our other carriers will invade Freya in a similar operation.", -1)
